## About

The job is scheduled using Quartz, and the batch job consists of reading user data, processing it to create email notifications, and sending those emails.

## How to execute the project

1. Clone the project from GitHub

   ````https://github.com/felipeam10/send-book-email-spring-batch````

2. In your preference IDE, open the project from the directory it was cloned to. 

3. Have the docker container installed on your computer. 

Before, locate the file in this project: ````\send-book-email-spring-batch\docker-compose.yml````

Climb structure:

``` 
docker-compose up -d
```

Stop structure:
```
docker-compose down
```
#### Data for connect to phpMyAdmin
- Server: mysql-docker
- User: root / user
- Password: 1234567

#### Data for connect to MySQL Workbench
- Host: 127.0.0.1
- Port: 3307
- User: root / user

4. After to climb your Docker, access phpMyAdmin for manager your database: http://localhost:5050/index.php
5. In "Servidor" type "mysql-docker", use user "root" whith password "1234567".
6. Now, after you logged in database. You will to create the database with name "library". And too you will have create tables and populate her. The script for your database is in the file ````\send-book-email-spring-batch\import.sql````. 
7. In table ````tb_user```` alter the collumn ````email```` to your email to be received.
8. In table ````tb_user_book_loan```` alter the collumn ````loan_date```` to the current date you are in minus 06 days. Change at least one line.

``` 
Important:
Run the query to verify that it returns the results for the changed fields:
```
#### Query to get users who have borrowed books close to return (business rule: books must be returned or renewed within 7 days / Read Step)

```sql
SELECT
    user.id as user_id, 
    user.name as user_name, 
    user.email as user_email, 
    book.id as book_id, 
    book.name as book_name, 
    loan.loan_date 
FROM tb_user_book_loan as loan 
INNER JOIN tb_user as user ON loan.user_id = user.id 
INNER JOIN tb_book as book ON loan.book_id = book.id 
WHERE DATE_ADD(loan_date, INTERVAL 6 DAY) = DATE(NOW());
```

9. Now you will configure the Send Grid Plattform, read the file ````SendGridDetails.txt```` in resource folder. I suffered a lot. I hope you don't suffer as much.
10. In class ````ProcessLoanNotificationEmailProcessorConfig.java```` and in the method ````process```` insert your email that was configurate in Send Grid for to send.
11. In class ````QuartzConfig.java```` and in the method ````jobTrigger```` configure the time for your job execution.
